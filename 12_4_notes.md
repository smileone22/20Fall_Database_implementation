Class Note for 12/4
# Workflow
1. write code
2. run it 
3. inspect output 

# Creating applications
* doing one time data migrations
* generating reports / files

In the python ecosystem
there is jupyterlab and jupyternotebook

# Notebooks (literate programming)
* Mix of code, output, inline text, documentation all together
* As you run code, you will see output immediately and you can run more codes 
* jupyterlab is the newer one 
* create Notebooks
* manage files
* edit files
* based on web
* you have to run a separate server on your computer
* jupyter lab> localhost:8888
* a notebook is actually json (even though there is python code in it)
