1. show exactly two documents from the listings collection in any order
db.listings.find().sort({'accommodates':1}).limit(2).pretty()

2. show exactly 10 documents in any order… but print in easier to read format and noting the host names for further use
db.listings.find().sort({'maximum_nights':1}).limit(10).pretty()


3. choose two host names… and show all of the listings hosted by 
either of the two hosts (for example, "Kamilla" or "Sonder"… 
though these two names may not exist in the latest data set)
only show the name, price, neighbourhood, and host_name
var obj= {$or:[{host_name:'Tommy'},{host_name:'Joe'}]}
var proj={_id:0,'name':1,'price':1,'neighbourhood':1,'host_name':1}
db.listings.find(obj,proj)


4. find all the unique host_name (see the docs)
db.listings.distinct('host_name')

5. find all of the places that have more than 2 beds in city 
(referred to as neighbourhood_group_cleansed in json file) Brooklyn, 
ordered by review_scores_rating descending
only show the name, beds, city, review_scores_rating, and price
if you run out of memory for this query, 
try filtering review_scores_rating that aren't empty ($ne)… 
and lastly, if there's still an issue, you can set beds to exactly 2


6. show the number of listings per host 
var groupBy = {$group: {_id:"$host_id" , countListings:{$sum: 1}}}
db.listings.aggregate([groupBy])

var groupBy = {_id:'$host_id , countListings:{$sum: 1}}
db.listings.aggregate([{$group:groupBy}])

7. in city (again, use neighbourhood_group_cleansed), Manhattan, 
find the average review_scores_rating per neighbourhood, 
and only show the ones above a 95… sorted in descending order of rating
